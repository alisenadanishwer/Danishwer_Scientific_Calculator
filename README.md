# Danishwer_Scientific_Calculator
This is an output of the scientific calculator application developed in this research using PySide6 library in Python. This application should also come with the basic arithmetic functions such as the additions and subtractions as well as the complex functions such as the trigonometric functions, logarithms or square roots. It consists of the main window with areas that cannot be edited by the user which includes an input field and buttons forming a grid with figures and numbers as well as the mathematical operations. They use mouse clicks or keyboard input to interact with it and is independent of other program or system files. It calculates and interprets the mathematical expressions using a programâ€™s integrated feature known as eval and obtains mathematical expressions from the Python standard utility package.
